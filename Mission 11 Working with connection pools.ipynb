    "Little Lemon’s guests need to access the database for any booking or inquiry, for example, reading the menu. Little Lemon, therefore, needs to establish a connection between the Python and MySQL databases for every operation.  Establishing a connection every time is resource intensive and it is affecting the performance of the Little Lemon application. To improve the performance of the application, Little Lemon needs to establish a pool of database connections to facilitate the guests’ inquiries to the database. "
